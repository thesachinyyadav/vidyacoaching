3. Add sample data for the new board

### Adding New Grades
1. Update the `Grade` type in `src/types/index.ts`

## Data Management

Currently uses mock data stored in `src/data/mockData.ts`. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Replace mock data functions with API calls
2. Update the context to handle async operations
3. Add error handling and loading states
4. Implement authentication for admin access
